# alias "ls" to run eza, which is very much like ls, but provides highlighting
# fo permissions, and lets us have a nice header at the top to remind us which
# column is which. by default, eza also does not show the . and .. entries,
# which is nice
alias ls="eza --group-directories-first"

# alias ll to run "eza -lah --group-directories-first". this is kind of abusing
# the alias, but whatever 
alias ll="ls -lah"

# alias "grep" to run "grep --color"
alias grep="grep --color"

# alias "mv" to run "mv -iv" to get a little confirmation
alias mv="mv -iv"

# alias "cp" to run "cp -iv" to get a little confirmation
alias mv="cp -iv"

# alias lfcd to just lfc so we can type a bit less
alias lfc=lfcd

# create an alias for isync / mbsync
alias mbsync="mbsync -c ~/.config/isyncrc"
